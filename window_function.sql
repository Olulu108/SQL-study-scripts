------------------------------Use the ROW_NUMBER() function to add a new column called rn (row number). For each customer, the new column should contain a number that indicates how recent the order was, with 1 being the oldest (or first) order.Use the RANK() function to achieve the same thing in another column called rk.

  `qualified-root-302819.course17.gwz_orders_17`
ORDER BY
  customers_id





------------------------------compare the values in the rn and rk columns for the customers with customers_id in (212497,205343,33690). How would you explain the difference between the two values?

------------------------------Add a new column is_new which is equal to 1 if the order is the first customer order and 0 otherwise. Calculate the rn column using the ROW_NUMBER() function.
Calculate the column is_new based on the rn column.
